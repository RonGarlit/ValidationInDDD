Welcome to the Validation in DDD course
=====================

This is the source code for my [Pluralsight course about Validation in DDD][L1].

How to Get Started
--------------

No need to set up a database, just hit F5 and you are good to go!

Source code for each module
---------------------------

Source code for each module is tagged and available on the [Releases tab][L2]. For example, tag "module-2-introduction" indicates the state of the sample project at the beginning of module 2, which is named "Introduction".
